# METHOD #2
# Use our own hardcoded shader code. Generally this is a bad idea in a
# general purpose program as there are so many things VTK supports that
# hardcoded shaders will not handle depth peeling, picking, etc, but if you
# know what your data will be like it can be very useful. The mapper will set
# a bunch of uniforms regardless of if you are using them. But feel free to
# use them :-)
